  Enabling this option instructs the plugin to trust any SSL certificate presented by the server, regardless of its validity.<br/>
  <b>Note:</b> This is useful for development and test environments where SSL certificates may not be properly configured or self-signed.
  Use with caution in production environments, as it bypasses certificate validation and could expose your system to security risks.
